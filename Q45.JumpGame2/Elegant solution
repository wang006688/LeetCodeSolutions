            int rNew = 0;
            for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) rNew = Math.max(rNew, i + nums[i]);

For each step of jump, there is a range you can reach. Then try jumping from each position in current range, 
you will get a new range where the next step can reach. Repeat this process util the range covers the last index.
