The idea is that when rotating the array, there must be one half of the array that is still in sorted order. 
For example, 6 7 1 2 3 4 5, the order is disrupted from the point between 7 and 1. 
So when doing binary search, we can make a judgement that which part is ordered and whether the target is in that range, 
if yes, continue the search in that half, if not continue in the other half.
