The basic idea is to find the relationship between the increse of number of digit 1 and each digit. 
For example, let (edcba) be a number, I want to find a relationship that represents how number of digit 1 
incresed with the current digit, like f(e) = countDigitOne(edcba)-countDigitOne(dcba). Once such function is identified, 
the total number of digit 1 can be iteratively calculated.

The following is the process to identify the relationship(function f()): The function (f(e)) is defined as the number 
of digit 1 increased because of digit e. (i.e. compared to there was no digit e, just (dcba), for example).

We take (edcba) as a number like 12345 (e =1, d=2,c=3,b=4 and a =5) here.

Start from f(a), it's obvious that if a=0, f(a) = 0, if a >0, f(a)=1.

Then f(b). If b =1,since countDigitOne(11) = 4 while countDigitOne(01) =1 ,and countDigitOne(19) = 12 while 
countDigitOne(09) = 1, it shows that f(b) = 1 + a +1.

If b>1, since countDigitOne(21) = 13 while countDigitOne(01) = 1 and countDigitOne(99) = 20 while countDigitOne(09) = 1, 
f(b) = b + 10;

Similarly,

if c=1, f(c) = 20 + 10b+a+1; if c>1, f(c) = 20c+100;

if d = 1, f(d) = 300+100c+10b+a+1; if d>1, f(d) = 300d+1000;

The relationships between the parameters are easy to find out. Take f(d) as an example, 300 = f(a)+f(b)+f(c) 
when (a = b = c = 9 ), that is 1+19+280 = 300, which essentialy is the countDigitOne(999). 1000 = 101010, and 100c+10b+a 
is the value of number (cba).

With these relationships, a scan and accumulate from lowest digit can lead to the answer.
